# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, various techniques like Random Undersampling, SMOTE, and Near-Miss were implemented to handle class imbalance. The models trained include Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and K-NN, achieving a recall of 0.91.
